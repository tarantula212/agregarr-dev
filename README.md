# Agregarr (bitr8 fork)

Active fork of [Agregarr](https://github.com/agregarr/agregarr) packaging performance fixes, placeholder lifecycle improvements, and open upstream PRs into a single Docker image. Builds automatically to `bitr8/agregarr:develop` on Docker Hub.

## Docker Image

Available on Docker Hub as [`bitr8/agregarr`](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitr8/agregarr). `develop` and `latest` tags are identical — both track the develop branch with all fork features included. Rebuilds on every push.

**Multi-arch** — supports amd64 and arm64 (Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4+).

**Switching from upstream?** Replace the image line in your existing compose file — config volumes are compatible:

```diff
-    image: agregarr/agregarr:latest
+    image: bitr8/agregarr:develop
```

### Compose example

```yaml
services:
  agregarr:
    image: bitr8/agregarr:develop
    container_name: agregarr
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/app/config
      - /path/to/placeholder/movies:/data/movies # Optional: Coming Soon
      - /path/to/placeholder/tv:/data/tv # Optional: Coming Soon
    environment:
      - TZ=Australia/Sydney
      - PUID=1000 # Your host user ID (run `id -u`)
      - PGID=1000 # Your host group ID (run `id -g`)
      - UMASK=022
    ports:
      - 7171:7171
    restart: unless-stopped
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> **File permissions:** You must set `PUID` and `PGID` to match the user that owns your media directories. Without these, the container runs as root and creates directories with restrictive permissions — which breaks imports in Sonarr, Radarr, and other apps that run as a non-root user. On Unraid, use `PUID=99` and `PGID=100`.

For general Agregarr configuration (services, collections, overlays etc.), see the [upstream docs](https://agregarr.org/docs/installation) — note that they reference the upstream image, not this fork.

## Relationship to upstream

This fork tracks upstream Agregarr and stays GPL-3.0. Changes that fit upstream go back as PRs (46 merged, 11 open). Fork-only features are documented separately — they rely on behaviour or trade-offs upstream may not want to adopt.

## Fork-Only Features

Two problem areas drove most of these changes: sync performance at scale (40+ collections, 10k+ items) and placeholder lifecycle gaps that leave orphaned entries in Plex. Early groundwork for Jellyfin support is underway.

### Dashboard Sync Progress Cards

Both collection and overlay syncs get unified side-by-side dashboard cards with live progress, stats, ETA, and start/stop controls. Cards are sticky -- they show last completed results when idle, and display "Waiting for..." when queued behind another job.

### Performance

Upstream Agregarr makes individual API calls per item, per rating source, per cache miss. With 40+ collections and 10k+ items, syncs take hours and hammer external APIs. These changes reduce that to minutes.

| Fix                             | Why                                                   | Impact                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Batch IMDb Prefetch**         | Upstream fetches IMDb ratings one item at a time      | Thousands of API calls reduced to tens                     |
| **Adaptive TTL Caching**        | All cached ratings expire at the same fixed interval  | New releases: 12h, older content: up to 30 days            |
| **Configurable Rating Cache**   | No way to tune cache duration                         | `ratingsCacheMaxDays` in settings.json (default: 30)       |
| **Collection Sync Cache**       | `getAllCollections()` called on every loop iteration  | Cached with mutation-based invalidation. Saves ~25-30s     |
| **Batch Overlay Metadata**      | Plex metadata fetched one item at a time              | Batches of 200 per API call. Falls back on failure         |
| **FlixPatrol CloudflareSolver** | Hardcoded browser-spoofing headers stopped working    | Uses Playwright-based solver, same as Letterboxd           |
| **WAF Solver Timeout Fix**      | IMDb pages never reach `networkidle`, WAF solve hangs | Uses `/chart/top/` for token acquisition, `load` wait      |
| **AniList Retry Cap**           | `parseInt` NaN bug causes infinite tight retry loops  | Capped at 5 attempts                                       |
| **Release Date TTL Cap**        | Stale cache shows wrong overlay for new releases      | Items within 3 days of release: max 2h TTL                 |
| **Sync Status Fix**             | Large multi-source collections stuck as "pending"     | Self-heal for stale ratingKeys + item-level 404 resilience |
| **TMDB Random Graceful Fail**   | No random collection throws, blocks entire sync       | Warns and skips, existing collection preserved             |

**Persistent TMDB Resolution Cache** -- Letterboxd collections require resolving titles to TMDB IDs. Upstream re-resolves every item on every sync (6 TMDB API calls each). This caches results in SQLite with adaptive TTL.

| Metric          | First Sync (cold cache)     | Second Sync (warm cache) |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| TMDB API calls  | ~33,000                     | 0                        |
| Resolution time | ~42 min                     | < 1 sec (all cache hits) |
| Cache entries   | 5,656 created (53 negative) | 5,656 served             |

**Plain HTTP for Letterboxd** (`letterboxdUsePlainHttp`) -- Upstream launches headless Chromium (Playwright) for every Letterboxd page fetch. This was added to bypass Cloudflare, but Letterboxd list pages return full HTML without JS rendering. Plain HTTP (axios) is sufficient.

|                   | Playwright | Plain HTTP |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Per page          | ~10,500ms  | ~280ms     |
| 142 pages         | ~25 min    | ~40 sec    |
| Cloudflare blocks | 0          | 0          |

Enable via **Settings > Sources > Fetching Settings** in the UI. Defaults to off (Playwright) for safety. Flip back if Cloudflare starts blocking.

**Plain HTTP for FlixPatrol** (`flixpatrolUsePlainHttp`) -- Same approach as Letterboxd. FlixPatrol top 10 pages return full HTML without Cloudflare challenges. Applies to all 3 fetch paths (platform top 10, country list, platform discovery).

Enable via **Settings > Sources > Fetching Settings** in the UI. Defaults to off (Playwright) for safety.

### Placeholder Lifecycle Fixes

Upstream placeholder cleanup has gaps that leave orphaned entries in Plex and don't respond to filter changes.

**Retroactive Filter Application** -- Upstream filters only apply at creation time — adding filters later has no effect on existing placeholders. This fork evaluates existing placeholders against the current filter config during cleanup and removes those that no longer pass. Rating filters are skipped since unreleased content has no ratings.

**Self-Healing for Stuck Records** -- If a placeholder file is deleted externally (disk issue, manual cleanup), the DB record blocks re-creation. This fork detects missing files and clears the stale record so the next sync can recreate it. Only triggers on confirmed ENOENT, not transient filesystem errors.

**Direct Plex Deletion** -- Plex ignores empty directories during library scans, so `scanLibrary()` + `emptyTrash()` won't clean up stale entries after a placeholder file is removed. This fork deletes stale items directly via `DELETE /library/metadata/{ratingKey}`, matching by exact file path. Falls back to scan+trash when direct deletion can't find matches.

**TV Episode Cleanup** -- TV placeholders create an S00E00 episode that persists in Plex after the placeholder file and DB record are cleaned up. Upstream cleanup queries shows, not episodes, so TV paths never match. This fork pre-resolves episode ratingKeys before file deletion and navigates show > Season 00 > Episode 0 to delete stale episodes during config cleanup.

**Sonarr Folder Naming** -- Agregarr creates placeholders at `/tv/Show (2024)/` but Sonarr uses `/tv/Show (2024) [imdbid-tt1234567]/`. When real content arrives, Plex sees them as different shows, leaving orphaned entries. This fork extracts the folder name from Sonarr's series path. Falls back to standard naming if the show isn't in Sonarr.

**Download Status Awareness** -- Upstream doesn't check whether content has already been downloaded in Radarr/Sonarr. This fork queries \*arr download status in batch, skips placeholder creation for items already downloaded, and uses download status as a cleanup signal. Prevents unnecessary placeholders for content that's about to arrive.

**Post-Sync Hub Verification** -- After collection sync completes, queries each filtered hub and applies missing `trailer-placeholder` labels to any items that slipped through. A safety net that catches label leaks regardless of which pipeline stage failed to apply them.

**TV Placeholder Label Cleanup** -- Upstream only removes the `trailer-placeholder` label during full sync's discovery path. Quick sync (when real content arrives between full syncs) cleaned up files and DB records but left the label on the Plex show, hiding it from Recently Added. This fork centralises label removal into all cleanup paths and adds a `tvdbId` fallback from the DB when marker files lack it.

**TV Placeholder Real Content Detection** -- Upstream's TV placeholder discovery never checks whether real content has arrived — when a Plex item exists for a marker, it always keeps it as a placeholder. Movies have this detection, but TV skips it entirely. This fork adds the same Plex metadata check: if the show has Season 1+ alongside Season 00, cleanup triggers. Sonarr download status is a secondary signal. Also fixes a truthy-empty-array bug where `Metadata || Directory` picks an empty array over a populated one, and makes label removal best-effort so transient Plex errors don't block cleanup.

### Coming Soon Improvements

**Prefer \*arr Release Dates** -- Upstream's TMDB enrichment unconditionally overwrites Radarr/Sonarr release dates, even when the \*arr source has more accurate data for monitored content. This fork preserves \*arr dates and only backfills from TMDB when a field is missing (e.g., Radarr has `digitalRelease` but no `physicalRelease`, TMDB fills the gap). Scoped to \*arr-sourced items only -- Trakt, TMDB, and Letterboxd sources still get TMDB dates as before. Logs a warning when \*arr and TMDB dates diverge by more than a week, so stale Radarr entries are visible in the logs.

**Announced Movies Without Dates** -- Upstream silently drops Radarr movies that have no release date fields at all (common for early announcements with `status: announced`). These items never reach TMDB enrichment, so TMDB can't provide dates either. This fork lets them through to enrichment, where TMDB can fill in theatrical or digital dates. Items that are still dateless after enrichment are filtered out by the existing post-enrichment date window check.

**Root Folder Filtering** -- Coming Soon monitored settings now include optional root folder dropdowns, populated from Radarr/Sonarr. Movies filter by path prefix, TV shows by `rootFolderPath` equality. Useful when multiple libraries point to different root folders on the same \*arr instance.

| Direct Plex API deletion for stale placeholders | Requires "Allow media deletion" in Plex     |
| Post-sync hub verification for label leaks      | Safety net for fork's label-based filtering |

> **Note:** TV placeholders created before the Sonarr folder naming fix may not match Sonarr's naming convention. If orphaned placeholders appear after real content arrives, delete the placeholder folder and let the next sync recreate it correctly.
